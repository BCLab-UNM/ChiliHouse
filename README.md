Greetings, We are a multidisciplinary team whose goal is to innovate technologies to autonomously grow crop plants for Artemis missions. We will accomplish this goal by creating dexterous robotic system inside the established APH and the Veggie system. Plant health and water needs will be measured by sensors that our autonomous robots will use to make care decisions. As well as investigating adding pollination probes & chlorophyll fluorescence sensors. Since New Mexico chile peppers have been grown successfully on the International Space Station, we will continue to used them in addition to strawberries and arabidopsis.
