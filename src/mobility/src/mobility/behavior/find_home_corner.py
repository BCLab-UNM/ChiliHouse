This module provides an importable function that can be used in multiple
behaviors if necessary.

 it looks for a corner. This means it should generally be turning right. There
 are currently still cases where the rover will start going in the wrong
 direction. This is bad because another rover might be to the left of this
 rover, coming straight toward it.
